  <h2> <strong>About Me</strong></h2>
  <p> My name is Ian, I am from Newmarket Ontario. Before attendning Algonquin College, 
      I studied <q> Theatre Arts & Performance </q> <br> at Centennial College. I have many interests such as: <strong>Frogs</strong> and Video games.
       Games I play include,<b>Destiny 2</b>,<b>Diablo 3</b>,<b> Rocket League</b> <br> and <b>Pokemon</b>. I have had some experience with interactive media and design 
      from highschool, but this is my first time delving head on into it. <br> Though im learning this content, I still hold
      roots in the arts which I intend to input in my work. I have a pet cat named Tigger, but we nicknamed him 'Pig' <br> because he grew to be fat.
      My goals are to be successful and hapy with what I do. Though I thought that was acting, I am now more comftorable with<br> 
      Interactive media  and desgn as it suits my lifestyle much more commftorably.
